  <name>SongRec</name>
  <summary>An open-source, unofficial Shazam client for Linux, written in Rust.</summary>
  <description>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <p>- Recognize audio from an arbitrary audio file.</p>
    <p>- Recognize audio from the microphone.</p>
    <p>- Usage from both GUI and command line (for the file recognition part).</p>
    <p>- Provide an history of the recognized songs on the GUI, exportable to CSV.</p>
    <p>- Continuous song detection from the microphone, with the ability to choose your input device.</p>
    <p>- Ability to recognize songs from your speakers rather than your microphone (on compatible PulseAudio setups).</p>
    <p>- Generate a lure from a song that, when played, will fool Shazam into thinking that it is the concerned song.</p>

    <release version="0.3.2" date="2022-05-26">
      <description>
        <p>Add a checkbox into the graphical interface in order to disable or enable system notifications whenever recognizing a song (thanks to @damonhayhurst).</p>
        <p>Fix the bug that previously caused the Firefox user interface menus to blink on Linux after the "Search on YouTube" feature has been used (thanks to @ducaton).</p>
        <p>Update the French translation.</p>
        <p>Add safety checks in order to prevent potential crashes when handling corrupt configuration files or invalid audio devices.</p>
        <p>Change the path of the files saving user interface-related preferences in order to update a deprecated Rust crate (this may create a symbolic link from "~/.local/share/songrec" towards an preexisting "~/.local/share/SongRec" directory under Linux).</p>

    <release version="0.3.1" date="2022-04-22">

    <release version="0.3.0" date="2021-12-26">
      <description>
        <p>- Introduce a new command-line interface allowing to use microphone recognition from the command line, with the "recognize" and "listen" commands (thanks to @Hummer12007), keeping older command backwards compatibility.</p>
        <p>- Update the CSV export format in order to introduce new "track_key", "release_year" and "genre" columns (thanks to @tyd), where "track_key" is an identifier internal to the Shazam database.</p>
        <p>- Allow exposing song metadata through the standard DBus MPRIS interface (thanks to @Hummer12007).</p>
        <p>- Improve source code structure in order to split the dual CLI/GUI parts from the core thread communication and fingerprinting parts and from other platform-dependant utility code.</p>
        <p>- Update certain dependent crates to more recent minor versions, among other possible things in order to accept a higher LibreSSL version.</p>
        <p>- Add the program version without the program help output (see the "-h" or "-V", "--version" options).</p>
        <p>- Add a Polish translation (thanks to @qarmin).</p>

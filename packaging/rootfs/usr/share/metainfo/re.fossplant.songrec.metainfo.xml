    <p>SongRec is an unofficial Shazam client for Linux, writted in Rust. It allows you to easily find recognize songs from your speakers, microphone or audio files.</p>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <p>- Recognize audio from an arbitrary audio file.</p>
    <p>- Recognize audio from the microphone.</p>
    <p>- Usage from both GUI and command line (for the file recognition part).</p>
    <p>- Provide an history of the recognized songs on the GUI, exportable to CSV.</p>
    <p>- Continuous song detection from the microphone, with the ability to choose your input device.</p>
    <p>- Ability to recognize songs from your speakers rather than your microphone (on compatible PulseAudio setups).</p>
